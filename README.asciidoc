This is a stylesheet for transforming DocBook 4.5 to http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc].

== Dependencies

The XSLT is written in XSLT 2.0, so you'll need to run it with an XSLT 2.0 processor. You can use Saxon:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/Saxon-HE/9.2/saxonhe9-2-1-5j.zip/download

== Run It

Run a command like this to output the AsciiDoc:

java -jar saxon9he.jar -s book.xml -o book.asc d2a.xsl
